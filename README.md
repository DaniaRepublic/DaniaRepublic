## 👋 Hi, I’m Ivan Markin

I'm a systems-minded programmer, passionate about building efficient and purposeful software—from 3D game engines and low-latency multiplayer networking to web frameworks and options trading models.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- 🔧 Building fast, multiplayer-first 3D game engines in **TypeScript** for the browser  
- 🧠 Designing shared logic across server and client for real-time gameplay  
- 🎮 Integrating **Three.js**, **Rapier.js**, and **Supabase** for graphics, physics, and persistence  
- 🔍 Exploring performance tradeoffs in data structures, concurrency, and algorithms (Go, C++)  
- 💹 Trading options with custom breakeven and return calculators  
- 🔐 Building embedded systems for class projects (Arduino security systems)  
- ⚡ Configuring my workflow with **Neovim (Lua, LazyVim)** and tailored Zsh scripts  

### 📚 Interests
- 🚀 Game development, multiplayer architecture, and ECS patterns (like Flecs)  
- 🔬 System performance, serialization, and physics simulations  
- 🧠 Theoretical CS problems—bias-variance tradeoffs, graph theory, optimization  
- 📖 Russian literature and scene dissection  

### 🧪 Tools & Languages I Use Often
- TypeScript, Go, C/C++, Lua, Python  
- Three.js, Rapier.js, Supabase, Flecs, Raylib  
- Neovim, Deno, SQLite, Box2D  
- Git, Zsh, tmux, Markdown  

### 📂 Selected Projects
- 🕹️ **[Multiplayer 3D Game Engine](#)**: Tick-based server-authoritative engine for browsers  
- 🔁 **Options Trading Toolkit**: Calculate returns and breakeven for complex strategies  
- 📦 **Flecs Serialization Layer**: Custom JSON serialization for ECS worlds  
- 🔐 **Arduino Security System**: Real-world hardware security prototype  

### 🧭 Goals
- Optimize for simplicity, performance, and clarity  
- Build things that are small, fast, and fun  
- Always learning, always shipping
